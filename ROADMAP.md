# WA Commons Development Roadmap

This roadmap turns the project goals in [`GOALS.md`](GOALS.md) into an implementation sequence.

WA Commons is **exit-criteria driven**. Dates may be added for planning, but phases are not considered complete because a calendar deadline passed.

## North Star

Build useful, voluntary software where repeated use can create a measurable peace-positive economic or practical signal.

The first proof vehicle is **Experiment 001 — Peace Capital**.

## Current position — 2026-08-31

- **M1 — Reproducible Evidence Graph: COMPLETE.** Measured clean reproduction is recorded in `docs/M1_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- **M2 — Explainable company screener: IN PROGRESS.** The versioned user-policy language and deterministic evaluator are implemented; the remaining bounded path is #42 → #43 → #44.
- **M3 — Peace Capital paper portfolio: IN PROGRESS.** The preregistered evaluation specification is complete. The product-universe strategy is now **100-company engineering cohort → canonical TSE domestic listed-company universe**; the benchmark is a separately selected subset/view used for financial evaluation rather than an intermediate coverage universe.
- **Phase 5–6 future design:** a Purchase Route Router is preregistered as the first second-domain candidate. The current product strategy is **distribution-first / integration-first**: begin where users already browse or compare products, use thin browser/share/URL handoffs to invoke WA Commons, test books first, then electronics/PC parts, and treat standalone WA product search as an optional later client rather than the MVP acquisition surface. v0 is affiliate-free. See `docs/PURCHASE_ROUTER_PROPOSAL.md`. This is future design only and does not displace current M2/M3 work or waive Phase 5/6 gates.
- **Phase 0 governance cleanup remains open.** #8 ideological-bias red-team and #9 Japanese/English terminology review are still required and are not considered completed by later technical progress.

The project intentionally allows preparatory specification work for a later phase when that work reduces benchmark gaming or implementation ambiguity. This does not waive earlier phase exit criteria or any real-money gate.

---

## Phase 0 — Public foundation

### Purpose
Make the project understandable, challengeable, and contributable before building a large system.

### Deliverables
- [x] Publish README and manifesto.
- [x] Publish governance, security, and contribution principles.
- [x] Publish Experiment 001 scope.
- [x] Open first contribution issues.
- [x] Establish reuse-before-invention policy.
- [ ] Publish short / medium / long-term goals.
- [ ] Audit Japanese/English terminology.
- [ ] Complete first ideological-bias red-team.
- [ ] Establish a lightweight decision-log convention.

### Exit condition
A newcomer can understand the mission, identify what is uncertain, challenge a claim, and make a useful contribution without private onboarding.

### Current issues
- #8 Red-team manifesto/governance.
- #9 Review Japanese/English framing.

---

## Phase 1 — Evidence foundation — COMPLETE

### Purpose
Prove that consequential company classifications can be reproduced from versioned evidence rather than opaque model judgment.

### Workstream 1A — Evidence schema — DONE
- Define minimal evidence object.
- Separate observation, evidence, inference, policy, action, and outcome.
- Support `CONFIRMED`, `DISPUTED`, `UNKNOWN`, `EXPIRED`.
- Preserve correction history rather than silently rewriting it.

**Issue:** #2

### Workstream 1B — Source registry — DONE for M1 bootstrap
- Inventory public/licensed data sources.
- Record publisher, scope, access, cadence, license/terms, identifiers, history, evidentiary strength, and limitations.
- Prefer primary/public sources where possible.
- Adopt / watch / reject each candidate explicitly.

Future sources still require exact license/terms review at onboarding; M1 completion does not imply that every candidate source is cleared for redistribution.

**Issue:** #4

### Workstream 1C — Entity resolution — DONE
- Review existing OSS before writing a matcher.
- Test Japanese company names, aliases, subsidiaries, parent ownership, ticker/legal-name differences, and historical names.
- Choose or adapt the smallest sufficient reusable stack.
- Demonstrate a deterministic 100-company Japanese listed-issuer identity pilot with conservative strong-ID rules.

**Issue:** #3

### Workstream 1D — Threat model — DONE for M1
- Data poisoning.
- Source compromise/disappearance.
- False entity matches.
- Coordinated manipulation.
- Defamation / unsupported accusation risk.
- Model/tool compromise.
- Permission escalation.
- Privacy leakage.
- Benchmark gaming and financial misrepresentation.

**Issue:** #7

### Milestone M1 — Reproducible Evidence Graph — COMPLETE
For a small fixed company universe, material claims can be regenerated from versioned sources and rules with disputes, corrections and expiry visible.

Measured acceptance is recorded in `docs/M1_ACCEPTANCE.md` and the M1 result reports.

### Gate to Phase 2 — PASSED
The evidence foundation exists. This does **not** authorize real-money trading.

---

## Phase 2 — User policy and classification engine — IN PROGRESS

### Purpose
Let different users apply different peace-related values to a shared evidence layer without creating one official WA Commons moral score.

### Workstream 2A — Policy language — DONE
A small human-readable and machine-readable policy format now covers:
- exclusions vs preferences;
- thresholds;
- `UNKNOWN`, `DISPUTED` and `EXPIRED` handling;
- policy versioning;
- shareable/forkable non-official profiles.

Policy v0.1 intentionally emits `EXCLUDE / WATCH / NONE`; it does not infer `PASS` from missing evidence.

**Issue:** #5 — completed.

### Workstream 2B — Deterministic screening — IN PROGRESS
The claim-level evaluator exists. The remaining milestone work is deliberately split:

1. **#42 — M2.2a:** build the 100-company evidence coverage matrix.
2. **#43 — M2.2b:** run the same evidence snapshot through the current user-policy profiles and produce deterministic company-level research views.
3. **#44 — M2.2c:** build the minimal non-developer-readable explainable screener report.

Requirements remain:
- no consequential decision without an explicit rule;
- every non-NONE outcome explains which rule/evidence fired;
- policy and evidence versions are recorded;
- the same inputs reproduce the same result;
- missing coverage does not become clean/safe/PASS;
- LLMs may assist extraction/review but must not become the hidden source of truth.

### Workstream 2C — Evidence cards — DONE as a reusable component
Evidence Cards already expose:
- entity;
- relevant claim;
- source/provenance;
- evidence/retrieval dates;
- status and confidence;
- entity-resolution state;
- correction history;
- policy-layer separation;
- challenge/correction path.

The remaining M2 work is to connect these components across the complete fixed 100-company pilot in #44.

### Milestone M2 — Explainable company screener — NOT YET COMPLETE
Exit condition:
A non-developer can choose a policy and understand the visible decision and evidence state for every company in the fixed 100-company pilot, with at least two meaningfully different profiles evaluated against the same evidence snapshot.

### Gate to full M3 integration
Complete #42 → #43 → #44. Preparatory M3 specification/research and TSE-universe work may proceed in parallel where they do not depend on unfinished M2 behavior.

---

## Phase 3 — Peace Capital paper portfolio — IN PROGRESS

### Purpose
Test whether the product remains financially useful after value constraints are applied.

### Workstream 3A — Evaluation specification — DONE
The financial evaluation contract was fixed before portfolio results are generated. It defines:
- preregistered benchmark requirements;
- point-in-time membership and as-known-at-cutoff controls;
- diversification/concentration metrics;
- tracking difference/error;
- turnover;
- estimated cost scenarios;
- sector/factor drift;
- policy-threshold sensitivity;
- versioned reproducibility;
- benchmark-gaming safeguards.

**Issue:** #6 — completed. See `docs/PAPER_PORTFOLIO_EVALUATION.md`.

### Workstream 3B — Canonical Japan-equity universe — OPEN

The product universe and the financial benchmark are intentionally separate concerns.

1. **#46 — M3.2b1:** build one pinned canonical universe of domestic companies listed on TSE Prime, Standard and Growth. This is the direct scale step from the fixed 100-company engineering cohort to the broad Japan-equity company universe (roughly 3,700 companies; exact count is whatever the pinned official JPX snapshot establishes).
2. **#53 — M3.2b2:** run the existing conservative JPX/EDINET/NTA/GLEIF identity spine across that complete canonical TSE universe.
3. **#54 — M3.2d:** scale the completed #42 coverage-state machinery and already integrated evidence adapters across the complete canonical TSE identity universe.
4. **#55 — M3.2e:** scale the completed #43 deterministic policy screening across that same TSE-wide evidence snapshot.

The 100-company cohort remains a stable regression and explainability fixture. It is not an intermediate investment universe and is not replaced by a hand-picked 1,500-company stage.

### Workstream 3C — Benchmark selection and mapping — OPEN

1. **#45 — M3.2a:** research and pin the first broad Japan-equity benchmark, including point-in-time reproducibility and licensing constraints, before portfolio results are inspected.
2. **#50 — M3.3b:** ingest one pinned benchmark constituent/weight snapshot and map it onto canonical TSE identities from #53. The benchmark is therefore a versioned subset/view of the broader TSE universe.

Benchmark selection may proceed in parallel with #46/#53, but #50 requires both the adopted benchmark and canonical TSE identities.

### Workstream 3D — Portfolio constructor — OPEN

1. **#47 — M3.2c:** review mature OSS and define the minimum bounded constructor; do not select a method by observed return performance.
2. **#49 — M3.3a:** implement only the selected deterministic paper-only constructor and its versioned configuration.

Use mature portfolio libraries where possible. Do not invent an optimizer unless the OSS review demonstrates a gap.

### Workstream 3E — Market-return ingestion — OPEN

**#56 — M3.3c:** ingest the bounded market-return and corporate-action data required by the first evaluation period after #50 has fixed the mapped benchmark snapshot. Missing held-security returns fail closed.

Market-return ingestion remains separate from benchmark membership/mapping and constructor logic because each has independent data, licensing and failure modes.

### Workstream 3F — First integrated paper evaluation — OPEN

**#51 — M3.3d:** combine previously completed components without introducing new methodology inside the integration issue.

Required output includes:
- selected policy and evidence versions;
- TSE-wide evidence/screening provenance;
- mapped benchmark coverage and unscreened weight;
- excluded/WATCH/NONE coverage;
- resulting target portfolio;
- benchmark comparison;
- concentration and risk trade-offs;
- tracking difference/error;
- turnover and cost scenarios;
- sector/factor drift where coverage permits;
- threshold sensitivity;
- limitations, blocked intervals and negative results;
- complete reproduction manifest and output hashes.

### Milestone M3 — Peace Capital v0 — NOT YET COMPLETE
A user can create a reproducible paper portfolio aligned with their own policy and see the financial trade-offs honestly, while the underlying Japan-equity evidence universe remains broader than the selected benchmark.

### Gate to Phase 4
Demonstrate at least one concrete non-ideological user benefit such as research time saved, easier customization, clearer evidence, or lower decision friction.

---

## Universe expansion strategy

WA Commons expands **universes and evidence sources**, not hand-picked lists of interesting companies.

### Stage U1 — Fixed 100-company engineering cohort — CURRENT REGRESSION FIXTURE

The deterministic 100-company Japanese listed-issuer pilot remains the bounded cohort for M2 integration, regression work and explainability acceptance.

Purpose:
- stable identity regression target;
- coverage semantics;
- policy comparison;
- explainable screener completion.

It is not intended to be a representative hand-curated moral list or a permanent product universe.

### Stage U2 — Canonical TSE domestic company universe — NEXT

After the 100-company contracts are stable, #46 → #53 expands directly to the complete pinned domestic-company universe on TSE Prime, Standard and Growth.

Rules:
- use the official JPX listed-company universe, not maintainer preference or benchmark membership, to choose companies;
- pin the exact source snapshot/date and report the exact resulting company count rather than hard-coding an approximate count;
- preserve unresolved/disputed identities instead of forcing name-only matches;
- keep investment products and TOKYO PRO Market outside canonical v0.1 unless a later explicit scope issue changes that boundary;
- treat the canonical TSE universe as the reusable company-identity base for screening, benchmark mapping and future source adapters.

### Benchmark views — separate from universe expansion

A benchmark is not a coverage stage. #45 selects the benchmark for financial comparison and #50 maps its point-in-time constituents/weights onto canonical TSE identities.

This preserves two independent questions:

```text
Which Japanese listed companies can WA Commons identify and screen?
        -> canonical TSE universe (#46/#53/#54/#55)

What unconstrained portfolio should Peace Capital compare against?
        -> pinned benchmark view (#45/#50)
```

The benchmark may contain roughly hundreds or thousands of securities, but its size does not define the WA Commons company-coverage ceiling.

### Later universe expansion

After the TSE pipeline is stable, expansion can consider other Japanese exchanges/eligible security types and then international listed-company universes. Each expansion requires an explicit universe definition, source/rights review and identity acceptance rather than a hand-picked company list.

### Evidence expansion rule — source-by-source, universe-wide

Evidence should normally expand by adding one reviewed source adapter and applying it across the relevant whole canonical universe, for example:

```text
canonical TSE company universe
        ↓
SIPRI adapter across all eligible entities
        ↓
OECD NCP adapter across all eligible entities
        ↓
UFLPA / other official-list adapter across all eligible entities
        ↓
additional reviewed sources
```

Do **not** build the evidence graph by manually choosing companies because they are famous, controversial or personally interesting. Hand-picking would create selection and scrutiny bias.

For every source:
- preserve the source's narrow factual meaning;
- record coverage and source limitations;
- keep `UNKNOWN` / not-integrated / no-match states distinguishable;
- never translate missing records into innocence or guilt;
- complete licensing/terms review before redistribution/ingestion where required.

---

## Phase 4 — Product utility validation

### Purpose
Test the central adoption hypothesis: people must have a reason to use the product beyond supporting the mission.

### Workstream 4A — Pilot users
Recruit a small pilot group with diverse policy preferences.

Measure:
- time saved versus manual research;
- comprehension of evidence cards;
- correction/dispute rate;
- policy customization usage;
- repeated usage intent;
- portfolio trade-offs users consider acceptable/unacceptable.

### Workstream 4B — Adversarial evaluation
- False-positive hunt.
- False-negative hunt.
- Political/ideological bias review.
- Entity-resolution stress tests.
- Source-license audit.
- Accessibility and UX review.

### Workstream 4C — Publish negative results
If exclusions cause unacceptable concentration, evidence is too weak, or users do not find the tool useful, publish the finding rather than hiding it.

### Milestone M4 — Utility proof
There is evidence that at least one target user group wants the product for a practical reason.

### Kill / pivot rule
If no meaningful user benefit survives honest testing, do not proceed to financial execution. Reuse the Evidence Graph elsewhere or change the experiment.

---

## Phase 5 — Peace Router core

### Purpose
Extract the reusable infrastructure so Peace Capital becomes one client rather than the whole project.

### Core components
- Evidence Graph.
- Entity identity layer.
- User policy language.
- Explainable routing/ranking engine.
- Provenance and audit log.
- Appeals/corrections model.
- Domain adapter interface.

### Architecture target

```text
Sources
   ↓
Evidence + Identity
   ↓
User Policy
   ↓
Peace Router
   ↓
┌────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Investment │ Purchasing  │ Future domain│
└────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### Preregistered adapter test

The first future adapter candidate is the **Purchase Route Router** described in `docs/PURCHASE_ROUTER_PROPOSAL.md`.

Phase 5 must extract a genuinely domain-independent contract that can support both investment decisions and purchase-route decisions without duplicating the evidence/policy/audit stack. The purchasing proposal is therefore a test fixture for the abstraction, not authorization to fork a separate shopping architecture.

The purchasing client should also test a second abstraction boundary: **distribution surfaces are replaceable clients, not part of the Router core**. Browser extensions, share targets, URL handoffs and any future standalone WA search should all feed the same product-identity handoff and routing contract.

### Milestone M5 — Domain-independent router
A second domain can reuse the core without duplicating the evidence/policy/audit stack.

---

## Phase 6 — Second economic experiment

### Purpose
Test whether the mechanism generalizes beyond investing.

The second domain is still subject to evidence and utility gates rather than maintainer preference. The **first preregistered candidate** is purchase-route selection using a **distribution-first / integration-first** entry: meet the user on an existing shopping, retailer, publisher, search or comparison surface, accept an explicit item handoff, and compare *where to buy that exact item* using shared organization Evidence plus the user's own Policy.

This is deliberately **not** a requirement to build a new general shopping search engine, marketplace, universal ethical-retailer score, or price-comparison crawler. A standalone WA product search page is an optional later client only if measured demand and source rights justify it.

See `docs/PURCHASE_ROUTER_PROPOSAL.md` for the full product hypothesis and non-goals.

### Selection criteria
1. Direct user benefit exists.
2. Repeated use could create a peace-positive externality.
3. Participation is voluntary.
4. Evidence and rules are auditable.
5. A large share can be built from existing OSS/data.
6. The system can be tested without granting dangerous authority.

If the purchasing candidate fails these criteria in measured use or data/rights feasibility, return to other candidates such as procurement/vendor choice, banking/financial-product comparison, donations or another voluntary economic decision rather than weakening Evidence rules.

### Workstream 6A — Books integration-first mechanism test — PREREGISTERED

First test the routing mechanism on books while borrowing existing discovery behavior instead of asking users to begin shopping inside WA Commons.

Intended shape:
- user explicitly invokes WA Commons from a supported book page through a browser extension/side panel, share-to-WA action or URL handoff;
- ISBN direct entry remains a deterministic fallback;
- resolve the exact supported book/edition identity conservatively;
- enumerate a bounded set of legally/reproducibly discoverable purchase routes;
- keep seller, marketplace/platform and fulfillment actors distinct;
- resolve route organizations to WA Commons legal entities only where existing strong-ID rules support the match;
- apply user-owned Policy and explain which Evidence/rules fired;
- send the user to the external retailer to complete the purchase;
- do not require a first-party WA title-search catalog for the mechanism test.

Version 0 is **affiliate-free** and has no checkout, payment credentials or autonomous ordering.

Before implementation, a dedicated source/terms/integration task must verify ISBN metadata, the minimum page/URL identity context that may be used from each candidate discovery surface, browser-extension or share-target constraints, retailer discovery/deep-link paths, availability/price reuse rights, caching limits and any pricing assumptions. A browser extension is not a loophole around a site's current terms. Brainstorming claims are not source-registry adoption decisions.

Mechanism evaluation should measure exact identity quality by entry surface, invocation-to-result friction, alternative-route coverage, entity-resolution coverage, user route-opening/route-change behavior, repeat utility and uncertainty/dispute states. Ideological-filter usage is not the primary success metric.

### Workstream 6B — Electronics and PC-parts extension — PREREGISTERED AFTER 6A

Only after the Books mechanism demonstrates useful routing behavior, extend the same integration-first pattern to electronics and PC parts.

Additional requirements:
- use exact JAN/GTIN/model identifiers where possible;
- do not merge bundles, revisions, capacities, colors, regional versions or parallel-import variants by title similarity alone;
- treat price, stock, shipping and delivery information as timestamped observations with source/freshness, not stable company Evidence;
- never claim global cheapest/best routing beyond actual coverage;
- where data supports it, expose the observed cost difference between an unconstrained route and a user-policy-compatible route.

This stage is where retailers such as electronics specialists, marketplaces, manufacturer-direct stores and independent sellers may become comparable routes, but their inclusion depends on source rights and exact entity Evidence rather than a hand-picked preferred-store list.

### Purchasing experiment guardrails

- no universal WA Commons retailer morality or "Japan contribution" score;
- no assumption that a Japanese seller/platform proves domestic manufacture or domestic value added;
- missing retailer/parent/fulfillment Evidence remains `UNKNOWN`/unresolved rather than favorable or unfavorable;
- no affiliate commissions in v0;
- no autonomous purchase or payment authority;
- no broad browsing-history collection; integration clients inspect only the page/item the user explicitly invokes and request minimum necessary permissions;
- source and retailer terms/licensing must be reviewed before page-context extraction, ingestion, caching or redistribution;
- do not build a first-party product catalog merely to compensate for a failed integration path;
- the current M2/M3 issue order remains authoritative until those gates are complete.

### Milestone M6 — Two-domain proof
The same Peace Router core serves two different decision domains, and the second-domain experiment demonstrates direct user utility without duplicating the Evidence/Policy/audit stack or depending on one proprietary shopping surface.

---

## Phase 7 — Bounded autonomous maintenance

### Purpose
Add the agent capability that motivated WA Commons: persistence without broad authority.

### Agent jobs
- scheduled source re-checking;
- change detection;
- evidence expiry;
- revalidation;
- reopening unresolved evidence;
- detecting broken data sources;
- proposing entity merges/splits;
- preparing human review packets;
- applying reversible low-risk updates where explicitly authorized.

### Required guardrails
- least privilege;
- explicit action authority;
- rate limits;
- audit logs;
- reversible defaults;
- human approval for consequential financial/legal/political actions;
- no covert persuasion or impersonation.

### Milestone M7 — Relentless but weak agent
The system can maintain its evidence layer for an extended period with low human effort while remaining bounded and auditable.

---

## Phase 8 — Internationalization and ecosystem

### Purpose
Make the infrastructure usable beyond one country's politics, datasets, and assumptions.

### Workstreams
- multilingual documentation and UI;
- country/domain source adapters;
- local policy profiles;
- portable schemas and APIs;
- community-maintained data connectors;
- governance for disputes across jurisdictions;
- independent downstream implementations.

### Milestone M8 — Forkable commons
At least one independent group can operate or fork a compatible implementation without founder involvement.

---

## Phase 9 — Long-horizon peace infrastructure

This phase is intentionally exploratory. Candidates include:
- additional Peace Router domains;
- public-interest maintenance agents;
- commitment/evidence/resource/authority graphs;
- narrow ephemeral institutions with explicit budgets, permissions, expiry, and shutdown rules;
- interoperability standards for evidence, policy, audit, and agent authority.

The project should only enter these areas when earlier phases demonstrate user utility, safety, and governance capacity.

## Agent-sized task contract

Roadmap phases and workstreams are **planning umbrellas, not worker assignments**. A strong autonomous coding/research model such as Claude Sonnet-class or GPT Luna MAX-class should receive one exact GitHub Issue at a time.

An Issue is ready for autonomous assignment only when all of these are true:

1. **One durable outcome:** one primary artifact, decision record, component or integration result can be reviewed independently.
2. **Durable prerequisites:** every required predecessor is complete and versioned; the worker is not asked to invent missing upstream contracts.
3. **One dominant uncertainty/failure family:** research selection, source licensing, parsing/ingestion, algorithm design, implementation and end-to-end acceptance are split when they can fail independently.
4. **Explicit inputs and outputs:** the Issue names which prior artifacts/contracts it consumes and what the next task may rely on.
5. **Finite Definition of Done:** completion is observable through hashes, counts, invariants, targeted tests, a decision table or another reproducible acceptance result.
6. **Stop/block conditions:** the worker knows when to stop rather than silently substituting data, weakening identity rules, expanding scope or redesigning methodology.
7. **Out-of-scope boundary:** adjacent discoveries become separate issues; they do not authorize opportunistic framework work.
8. **Proportional verification:** verification targets the changed claims/failure modes; broad suites are reserved for shared-core or milestone gates.
9. **Context-fit:** the task can be understood from the exact Issue, directly referenced contracts and the smallest relevant source/tests without loading the entire repository history.
10. **Durable handoff:** if a run cannot finish safely, it leaves `COMPLETED / OBSERVED / RULED_OUT / NEXT_ACTION / DEFERRED` evidence and a bounded Git checkpoint.

If an Issue fails this checklist, split or respec it **before** handing it to an autonomous worker. Do not compensate for an oversized task by giving the model a giant prompt or repeatedly relaunching it.

## Task-granularity audit — 2026-08-30

Current near-term issues after respec:

- **#42 — READY:** one coverage artifact; state semantics and tests are explicit. Existing autonomous-worker contract is suitably bounded.
- **#43 — READY after #42:** one deterministic screening artifact; policy/evidence traceability is explicit.
- **#44 — READY after #43:** one minimal explainability report/milestone review; broad production UI is explicitly excluded.
- **#45 — READY research task:** one benchmark decision record; no implementation/backtest is permitted.
- **#46 — READY:** narrowed to canonical JPX/TSE universe enumeration only. Identity enrichment was split out.
- **#53 — READY after #46:** one TSE-wide identity artifact; source-format failures have explicit stop behavior.
- **#54 — READY after #42/#53:** one TSE-wide evidence-coverage artifact using existing adapters only.
- **#55 — READY after #43/#54:** one TSE-wide deterministic policy-screening artifact.
- **#47 — READY after #45:** one OSS/constructor design decision; implementation and returns remain separate.
- **#49 — READY after #47:** one constructor implementation with fixed fixtures/invariants.
- **#50 — READY after #45/#53:** narrowed to benchmark constituent/weight ingestion + canonical TSE mapping; return history was split out.
- **#56 — READY after #50:** one bounded market-return/corporate-action ingestion artifact.
- **#51 — READY only after all prerequisites:** pure integration/evaluation; methodology changes are explicit blockers.

Phases 4–9 are **not yet worker-ready as whole tasks**. `docs/PURCHASE_ROUTER_PROPOSAL.md` is likewise a preregistered future design, not a worker assignment. Before execution, each workstream must be converted into Issue-sized contracts using the checklist above; agents should never be assigned “do Phase 4”, “build Peace Router”, “build the Books Router”, “internationalize WA Commons”, or similar roadmap-sized prompts.

## Task-splitting discipline

To keep work bounded and failures local:

- one issue should have one clear artifact or integration goal;
- research/selection, implementation, data ingestion and end-to-end acceptance should remain separate when they can fail independently;
- later issues must consume completed, versioned outputs rather than silently redesigning earlier methodology;
- if an issue grows beyond its stated scope, split it instead of broadening acceptance criteria;
- each implementation issue should have targeted tests and exact changed-file review before merge;
- scaling row count alone does not require an artificial intermediate universe when the same deterministic pipeline can run over a complete source-defined universe.

## Hard gates

WA Commons should **not**:
- add real-money autonomous trading before evidence, reproducibility, threat modeling, user-utility validation, financial/legal review, credential architecture, risk controls and explicit governance approval;
- generalize into many domains before Experiment 001 teaches us what the reusable core actually is;
- treat the preregistered Purchase Route Router proposal as authority to bypass Phase 5 or the measured Phase 6 selection/utility gate;
- build custom infrastructure before an OSS reuse review;
- hide disputed evidence to make the product look cleaner;
- treat missing evidence as PASS/clean/safe;
- choose companies manually because they look controversial when a universe-level selection rule is available;
- insert an arbitrary intermediate company universe merely to reduce row count when the canonical source-defined universe is tractable;
- choose or replace a benchmark after observing performance to improve headline results;
- grant agents broad authority merely because the software is technically capable of it.

## Immediate next work

The nearest bounded sequence remains:

1. **#42 — M2.2a:** 100-company evidence coverage matrix.
2. **#43 — M2.2b:** deterministic 100-company policy screening.
3. **#44 — M2.2c:** explainable screener report and explicit M2 exit review.

The canonical TSE scale path **#46 → #53** may proceed independently of #45 where capacity permits. After the 100-company semantics are complete, reuse them as **#54 → #55** over the full TSE universe.

In parallel only where dependencies allow, **#45** may research and preregister the first Japan-equity benchmark. Portfolio constructor work (#47 → #49), benchmark mapping (#50), market-return ingestion (#56) and end-to-end evaluation (#51) remain separate bounded issues.

The Purchase Route Router remains **future preregistered design only**. It does not enter the immediate work queue until the relevant Phase 5/6 gates are met or a separately authorized bounded source/rights/integration research issue is created.
